Brain Tumor MRI Image Classification

Project Overview:
This project focuses on the development of an automated system for brain tumor classification using deep learning techniques, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The primary objective is to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of diagnosing brain tumors from MRI images, thereby assisting radiologists in making timely and accurate diagnoses. The project employs three advanced CNN architectures—ResNet50, Inception V3, and VGG16—to classify MRI images into four categories: glioma, meningioma, pituitary tumor, and no tumor.

Objectives

•	Model Performance Assessment: The objective is to evaluate and compare the performance of trained CNN models using metrics like accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and F1-score to identify the most reliable model for brain tumor classification.

•	Model Comparision:  to compare the trained CNN models—ResNet50, Inception V3, and VGG16—based on their performance metrics to determine which model most effectively and accurately classifies brain tumors from MRI images.
